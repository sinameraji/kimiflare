/**
 * Custom OpenAI-compatible endpoint routing.
 *
 * When `KIMIFLARE_BASE_URL` is set (or `baseUrl` in config), every model call
 * is sent to `<baseUrl>/chat/completions` with
 * `Authorization: Bearer <KIMIFLARE_API_KEY>` — and every Cloudflare path is
 * bypassed: no account-id URLs, no cf-aig-* headers, no BYOK / Unified
 * Billing logic, no Cloudflare token, and no whoami-style preflights.
 *
 * This is how a host application (e.g. an agents platform running kimiflare
 * inside a container) points the CLI at its own gateway/broker instead of
 * handing the process a raw Cloudflare token. The broker terminates the
 * bearer it issued and forwards to AI Gateway (or any OpenAI-compatible
 * upstream) with credentials that never enter this process.
 *
 * Precedence (per field): env var > config field. When a custom endpoint is
 * active it wins over cloud mode, the AI Gateway Universal Endpoint, the
 * cf-catalog path, and the direct Workers AI path. Model ids pass through to
 * the body unchanged — no `workers-ai/` prefixing, no Cloudflare id-shape
 * validation.
